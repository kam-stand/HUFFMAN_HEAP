# Huffman Coding using Min Heap

This repository contains an implementation of Huffman Coding using a Min Heap. Huffman Coding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. The Min Heap is utilized to efficiently build the Huffman Tree, which is essential for encoding and decoding processes.

## Features

- Implementation of Min Heap data structure
- Construction of Huffman Tree using Min Heap
- ncoding and decoding of data using Huffman Coding

## Files

- `heap.c` - Implementation of Min Heap operations
- `heap.h` - Function prototypes
- `main.c` - Example usage of Huffman Coding


## To Implement
- [x] Emit huffman tree
- [ ] Proper `main.c` file to run tests
- [ ] `run.sh` needs to be fixes 

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kam-stand/HUFFMAN_HEAP.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```sh
   cd HEAP
   ```
3. Compile the code:
   ```sh
   ./run.sh
   ```
